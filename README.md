Different ways to create a custom action.

This example code is refered from wiki article: https://transferwise.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EKB/pages/1549557615/Creating+your+own+action

Here you can find examples of how to create very simple github action, with different approaches available.

This simple action prints out `hello world` (or `!FNAME!`, as set).
Then it takes a directory listing, from the path specified in input vars.
Output vars contain a timestamp, a random number and a result of directory listing.
